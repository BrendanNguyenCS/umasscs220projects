# umasscs220projects
This is a remote repository for all my UMass Boston Discrete Math (CS220) projects and files (LaTeX written in Overleaf online editor)

The LaTeX cheat sheets are not mine and were found randomly scouring the internet. I just added them to consolidate all the useful LaTeX tools to make the Overleaf experience easier for myself. Credit goes to their individual owners.

These solutions may or may not be correct so view at your discretion.
