# UMass Boston CS220 (Discrete Mathematics)
This is a remote repository for all my CS220 projects and files (LaTeX written in Overleaf online editor). All PDFs were created using LaTeX on Overleaf (pdfLaTeX compiler) and in the IntelliJ IDE with the TeXiFy IDEA extension (you must install LaTeX on your machine in order to use this). These solutions may or may not be correct so view at your discretion.
