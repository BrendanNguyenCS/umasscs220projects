# umasscs220projects
This is a remote repository for all my UMass Boston Discrete Math (CS220) projects and files (LaTeX written in Overleaf online editor)

The LaTeX reference sheet is a combination of two cheat sheets that I found randomly scouring the Internet. The credit goes to the creators of those individual documents. This reference sheet was created using an online PDF combiner to consolidate the majority of the tools necessary to be successful with LaTeX and the Overleaf online editor.

These solutions may or may not be correct so view at your discretion.
